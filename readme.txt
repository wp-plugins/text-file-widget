Displays the contents of a text file as a widget

== Description ==
This simple plugin allows you to display the contents of a text file as a widget, in any widgetized area provided by your theme (eg Sidebar)

There are no configuration options for this plugin - all configuration (such as there is) is done by the widget settings.

Only text is displayed - HTML is stripped out.

End-of-line characters are displayed as HTML \"Breaks\" 


== Installation ==
There are three possibilities:

*Use the standard Wordpress Plugins > "Add New" procedure (Recommended)

You can have multiple instances displaying different files.
